    The base pipeline is composed of three main phases: parsing, indexing and searching. For the parsing,
    the system can accept JSON or TREC files as input, from which it will clean the text by removing
    unwanted elements like HTML tags, links and special characters. The indexing phase is responsible for
    converting a collection of text documents into a searchable format using a text indexing framework. The
    system allows customization of how text is tokenized and compared. The searcher phase is responsible
    for executing search operations over the index using a set of predefined queries. It can apply advanced
    text processing techniques, including tokenization and synonym-based query expansion. The system
    supports configurable parameters and can integrate additional semantic tools to enhance relevance.
    The final ranked documents are put into a standardized output suitable for evaluation.
